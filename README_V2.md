## 🏗️ Architecture 2.0

### Two-Executable Design
Our latest architecture separates concerns for better performance and maintainability:

#### 📱 DDSFocusPro.exe (GUI Launcher)
- **Size**: 22.7 MB
- **Purpose**: Desktop GUI management and user interface
- **Technology**: Python + WebView (EdgeChromium)
- **Features**:
  - Instant startup with loading screen
  - Process lifecycle management
  - WebView window handling
  - Automatic cleanup on exit

#### ⚙️ DDSFocusPro Connector.exe (Backend Server)
- **Size**: 44.5 MB  
- **Purpose**: Flask backend server and data processing
- **Technology**: Flask web framework + SQLAlchemy
- **Features**:
  - HTTP API endpoints
  - Database operations
  - Screenshot processing
  - Activity monitoring logic

#### 🔄 Communication Flow
```
User → DDSFocusPro.exe → WebView UI → HTTP (localhost:5000) → DDSFocusPro Connector.exe
```

### Benefits of Two-Executable Design
- ✅ **Process Isolation**: GUI and backend run independently
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Optimized resource usage
- ✅ **Easier Debugging**: Separate logs and error handling
- ✅ **Modular Updates**: Update components independently
- ✅ **Improved Stability**: One component failure doesn't crash the other

## 🛠️ Development

### Build from Source
```bash
# Prerequisites
pip install pyinstaller webview flask psutil requests sqlalchemy

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dxdglobal/Client-Side-DDS-Focus.git
cd Client-Side-DDS-Focus

# Build both executables (clean build)
pyinstaller desktop.spec --clean --noconfirm
pyinstaller connector.spec --clean --noconfirm

# Quick build (uses cache)
pyinstaller desktop.spec && pyinstaller connector.spec

# Test the build
cd dist
.\DDSFocusPro.exe
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Run as Python script for full debugging
python desktop.py

# Run individual components
python app.py          # Backend only
python connector.py    # Backend wrapper
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 🚫 Application Won't Start
- **Check files**: Ensure both `.exe` files are in the same folder
- **Windows Security**: Allow through Windows Defender/antivirus
- **Permissions**: Try running as Administrator
- **Port conflict**: Ensure port 5000 isn't used by other apps

#### ⏳ Loading Screen Stuck
- **Wait**: Initial startup can take up to 30 seconds
- **Check logs**: Look at `logs/desktop.log` for error messages
- **Restart**: Close completely (check Task Manager) and relaunch

#### 🔍 Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with full console output for debugging
python desktop.py
```

### Log Files
Application creates detailed logs in the `logs/` directory:
- `desktop.log` - GUI launcher logs and process management
- `flask.log` - Backend server startup and HTTP requests  
- `app.log` - Application logic and business operations

## 🎯 Version 2.0 Highlights

### ✅ What's New
- **Two-executable architecture** for enhanced stability and performance
- **Fixed Unicode logging** issues that caused crashes on Windows systems
- **Improved path resolution** for PyInstaller executable environments  
- **Enhanced error handling** with comprehensive logging throughout
- **Instant UI loading** with proper background initialization
- **Robust process management** with automatic cleanup of old instances
- **Developer-friendly** debugging and build system improvements

### 🔄 Breaking Changes from v1.0
- Now requires **both executables** to be present in same directory
- Log file formats updated with new structured messaging
- Build process split into two separate PyInstaller specifications
- Backend server now runs as independent process rather than embedded
